          While working on <a href="/pages/projects/ithom.html">ITHOM</a>,
          it became necessary to develop a method of connecting disjoint rooms
          with corridors in a gridded world. I experimented with several
          algorithms and detailed what I learned.

          Ever since I made the switch from Windows to MacOS, I have been using
          <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> as my package manager since
          day one. It is a fantastic collection of resources which hugely
          magnify the capabilities of the terminal. I list some of the formulae
          I have found that are either useful or interesting in some way.
