        About this page
      </h2>
      <div class="indented">
        I enjoy playing video games in my spare time,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a>
        especially.
        Roguelikes are generally characterized by procedurally generated stages,
        an overall high level of difficulty, permanent player death when losing,
        and large amounts of replayability.
        Roguelikes that feature only one or two of these characteristics
        are usually called "rogue-lites".
        Usually, roguelikes have a steep learning curve with a lot of
        intricate mechanics that need to be understood in order to complete
        the game.
        I have collected the things I have learned from playing these games
        on their respective pages, in hopes they can help newer players succeed
        or inform experienced players of things they may not have previously
        been aware of.
        <br />
        It should go without saying that these pages contain spoilers for both
        plot and gameplay, so proceed at your own risk.

          Nethack is one of the oldest roguelikes I reguarly play.
          It remains one of the most popular roguelikes to date as well,
          and is available on nearly every system imaginable.
          As one of the most complicated rogulikes on this list, I will keep
          my tips as general as possible.

          Spelunky is a platforming rogue-lite which was originally made
          for Windows, and then later remade for Xbox 360 arcade.
          It features extremely tight controls and thematically cohesive
          game mechanics that make it one of my favorite games of all time.

            The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth

        </dt>
        <dd>
          The Binding of Isaac is a room-based twin stick shooter with
          roguelike elements.
          It has an enormous amount of content and decision-making that
          gives it a lasting amount of replayability.

          Downwell is a compact little rogue-lite released on both PC and iOS.
          There is very little actual strategy involved in playing,
          but the game nevertheless has the full feature set of a true roguelike.

        <dd>
          Enter The Gungeon is room-based twin stick shooter with roguelike
          elements, much like The Binding of Isaac,
          but is generally much slower and gameplay is more dependent on
          random elements rather than skill of the player.
          While there is much less choice and strategy in this game than most
          roguelikes, the player can make key decisions which will at
          least mitigate the chances of randomness making the game drab.

        <dd>
          Risk of Rain is not really a roguelike, but has a few elements
          (like permadeath), which makes it close enough to have an entry
          on this page.
          It is a platforming action game which also features
          online multiplayer.

          Rogue Legacy is an exploratory platformer with roguelike elements.
          It strays from the traditional format by allowing the player to
          purchase permanent upgrades before each playthrough.
