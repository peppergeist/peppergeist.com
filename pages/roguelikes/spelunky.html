                There are many items in Spelunky, and they all fall under three specific categories:
                <ul>
                    <li>Consumable - Multiple amounts of these items may be picked up and used one at a time. This category includes things like ropes and bombs.</li>
                    <li>Passive - These items, once picked up, cannot be dropped. They can be picked up multiple times, but it does not affect their efficacy.</li>
                    <li>Active - These items must be held in the spelunker's hands in order to be used. You may only hold one of these items at a time.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Rope</h3>
            Ropes are a consumable item which can be used to deploy a climable rope in front of the spelunker.
            If the player holds UP when deploying the rope, they will throw the rope up in the air, and if the player holds DOWN, they will drop the rope down in front of them.
            Ropes are useful for reaching areas out of reach and safely descending from cliffs when the ground is not visible.
            They can also be used to anchor the player's y-position when attempting to fight or blow up enemies and shops.
            If the player is holding on to a rope, they may throw a bomb in a downwards diagonal direction by holding DOWN and pressing the bomb button.
            This is useful for tossing bombs downwards into shops without risking the shopkeeper jumping high enough to reach you.
            Be wary if you are hanging on to a rope which is deployed above lava.
            The lava might catch the rope on fire and cause it to burn up and make it unusable.
            Ropes come in bundles of three, and can be found throughout the game.
            They are usually not worth buying in shops, though.
            
            <h3>Bomb</h3>
            Bombs are a consumable item which can be used to fight enemies and blow up terrain.
            Bombs are one of the most useful items in the game, for both their high efficacy in dealing with foes and for accessing treasure and other items.
            If the player holds the UP button when throwing the bomb, they will throw it in an upwards arc, and if the player is crouching when they throw it, they will instead drop the bomb at their feet.
            If the player has the pitcher's mitt, bombs thrown will not be affected by gravity and will continue in a straight line when thrown until they hit something.
            If the player has the paste, bombs will stick to walls and enemies, making them useful for attacking large dangerous enemies from a distance.
            Bombs come in bundles of 3, or in bomb boxes, which have 12 bombs in them.
            Since bombs are very useful and versatile, I strong recommend purchasing/stealing them from shops when given the chance.
            
            <h3>Spectacles</h3>
            The spectacles are a passive item which improve the player's vision.
            With them, you can see hidden treasure and items inside of walls and improve visibility in dark levels.
            They are not particularly useful as the Udjat Eye provides the same secret treasure vision.
            
            <h3>Climbing Gloves</h3>
            Climbing gloves are a passive item which allows the spelunker to grip walls.
            With this item, the player can scale vertical walls by jumping repeatedly.
            These gloves are extremely useful and I recommend picking them up as soon as possible.
            
            <h3>Pitcher's Mitt</h3>
            The pitcher's mitt is a passive item which allows the player to throw items in a straight line without them being affected by gravity.
            It is not particularly useful unless you are really trying to throw things at something far away.
            
            <h3>Spring Shoes</h3>
            The spring shoes are a passive item which allows the player to jump higher by one tile.
            They are very useful and can be found throughout the world and by killing giant frogs.
            If the player holds down the jump button when jumping on enemies, they will also bounce extra high with this item.
            
            <h3>Spike Shoes</h3>
            Spike shoes are a passive item which increases the damage done by the player when jumping on enemies.
            They also prevent the player from sliding on icy surfaces.
            Spike shoes also allow the player to deal stomping damage to enemies which are not normally damaged by jumping, like mammoths.
            
            <h3>Paste</h3>
            The paste is a passive item which makes the player's bombs stick to surfaces and enemies upon contact.
            Giant spiders drop paste when killed so it's generally not worth it to purchase this in shops.
            
            <h3>Compass</h3>
            The compass is a passive item which points the character to the level exit at all times.
            It is not very useful, but when the level is dark it can help in finding the exit.
            Also, when the player does not have much mobility while in the Ice Caves, it can help in finding the exit without having to consume ropes.
            
            <h3>Mattock</h3>
            The mattock is an active item which can be applied to destroy the tile either directly in front of the player or directly in front and down.
            There is always one generated at the bottom of snake pits.
            They can be useful for digging up treasure and reaching inaccessible areas without consuming bombs, and usually break after about 50 uses.
            It can also be used as a weapon, but is not particularly effective as one.
            
            <h3>Boomerang</h3>
            The boomerang is an active item which can be used to damage and stun enemies a short distance away from the player.
            When thrown, it will travel straight in the direction it was thrown for a little bit, and then return to the player and be automatically caught.
            Boomerangs are used as weapons in the Jungle by tiki men, who will throw it at you if they see you.
            It can be a useful weapon for stunning enemies and dealing damage in the early game, but should be dropped for a gun as soon as one becomes available.
            
            <h3>Machete</h3>
            The machete is an active item which can be used to damage enemies or slice through spider webs.
            It deals twice as much damage as the whip and can damage enemies that the whip cannot.
            However, since it must be held to be used, it is usually outclassed by other weapons which can inflict damage from a range.
            
            <h3>Crysknife</h3>
            The crysknife is a passive item which replaces the standard whip attack.
            It allows the player to instantly kill enemies in a single swing.
            It can only be found at the bottom of the secret Worm level, in a pool of acid near the bottom of the level.
            
            <h3>Web Gun</h3>
            The web gun is a near-useless active item which can be used to shoot balls of spiderweb a short distance.
            It's not worth holding on to.
            
            <h3>Shotgun</h3>
            The shotgun is an active item which is usually the most effective and practice weapon in the game.
            When fired, it shoots a spread of pellets which travel in a roughly straight line.
            The shotgun can be used to kill enemies from afar (including shopkeepers), and firing the gun right when pressing the jump button can allow the player to jumping slightly higher than normal.
            When using the shotgun to kill a shopkeeper that is off the screen, be sure to listen for the 'angry shopkeeper' music to stop before walking closer to investigate; sometimes it takes several shots for the pellets to do enough damage to kill him.
            Additionally, if only one pellet hits the shopkeepr, it will not stun him, so be wary of firing the gun when you don't have it lined up properly.
            
            <h3>Freeze Ray</h3>
            The freeze ray is an active item that fires a short-range burst of ice that freezes characters.
            Once frozen, the player must whip or jump on the frozen character, which will kill it instantly.
