      </h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Here you'll find my personal projects, mostly software.
        I am currently learning to draw and make music using a computer,
        so I have a lot of little games in development.
        I am also currently in the process of transitioning some of them
        from Clickteam Fusion Studio 2.5 to Gamemaker Studio 2, so most of them
        are pretty skeletal right about now.

      <div class="indented">
        <code>shakespeare-quote</code> is a small CLI program which displays
        a randomly-selected quote from one of Shakespeare's works when run.
        The actual software is complete, but I am still compiling lists of
        quotes from many of his plays.
        It was inspired by the ever-popular Unix program "fortune",
        which displays a random fortune when run.

      <h3><a href="/pages/projects/ithom.html">ITHOM</a></h3>
      <div class="indented">
        ITHOM is a text-based roguelike played in the terminal window.
        You play as a scamming miscreant who has made a living selling snake oil
        to people paranoid of catching an epidemic illness which leaves
        its victims in a permanent coma.
        A person becomes infected by falling asleep within the vicinity
        of someone who has already contracted it.
        Doing so imprisons that person's consciousness in a large,
        paradoxial dream dungeon known to its inhabitants as Mononeir.
        The marble halls of Mononeir wind slowly downwards into deeper
        and more dangerous depths.
        It is known there exists an archive, an academy, a prison,
        and more somewhere below where most inhabitants have taken refuge.
        Only by fighting your way downwards through the dreamlike labyrinth
        will you be able to find and confront the host of the dream,
        and perhaps find a way out...
        <br />
        <br />
        ITHOM is currently very in progress and only has preliminary
        dungeon-generation algorithms and map structures currently working.
        The project page is private as I would like to make it public
        once it has more content, and a website is in development for it
        as well.

      <h3><a href="/pages/projects/voltimand-land.html">Voltimand Land</a></h3>
      <div class="indented">
        Voltimand Land is an homage to the Wario Land series of games,
        featuring a treasure-hunting protagonist looting the remains
        of a spooky castle.
        It showcases many of the iconic mechanics, such as the charge
        and ground-pound, and adds a couple more.
        The art style is strongly inspired by Locomalito's
        <a href="https://www.locomalito.com/abbaye_des_morts.php">
          L'abbaye des Morts
        </a>,
        a little explorative platformer, and GameBoy Color palettes.

      <h3><a href="/pages/projects/prong.html">PRONG</a></h3>
      <div class="indented">
        PRONG is a classic-style RPG also in development.
        All the sprites on this site are assets from PRONG.
        You play as a rogue mailer daemon on a quest to return a letter.
        On the way, you can make friends, eat food, trick-or-treat,
        and possibly save the world.
        More information coming later
        (by later I mean as I flesh out the story more).

      <div class="indented">
        Number Tumbler is a teeny tiny game made in the Jack
        programming language for one of my classes in college.
        You can download from my GitHub page as well as play
        a demo version on it in your web browser.

      <div class="indented">
        <code>zigzag</code> is an extremely useless CLI program which takes text
        as input and prints it back to the terminal, but zigzagged.
        There is almost no situation in which this program is ever useful.
