        Gaap, alias Tap, Præses magnus &amp; Princeps: in signo Meridiei
        apparet: sed quum humanam assumit faciem [Clm 849, fol 66r: Apparet in
        signo medici cum suscipit figuram humanam; [est] doctor opti[m]us
        mulierum, et facit ardere in amorem virorum], ductor est præcipuorum
        quatuor regum, tam potens ut Byleth. Extiterunt autem quidam
        necromantici, qui huic libamina &amp; holocausta obtulere, &amp; ut
        eundem evocarent, artem exercuere, dicentes sapientissimum Salomonem eam
        composuisse, quod falsum est: imo fuit Cham filius Noë, qui primus post
        diluvium cœpit malignos invocare spiritus, invocavit autem Byleth, &amp;
        composuit artem in suo nomine, &amp; librum, qui multis mathematicis est
        cognitus. Fiebant autem holocausta, libamina, munera, &amp; multa
        nefaria, quæ operabantur exorcistæ admistis sanctissimis Dei nominibus,
        quæ in eadem arte sparsim exprimuntur. Epistola vero de iis nominibus
        est conscripta à Salomone, uti &amp; scribunt Helias Hierosolymitanus
        &amp; Heliseus. Notandum, si aliquis exorcista habuerit artem Beleth,
        nec ipsum coram se sistere possit aut videre, nisi per artem: Quomodo
        autem eundem continere oporteat, non est explicandum, quum sit nefandum,
        &amp; nihil à Salomone de ejus dignitate &amp; officio didicerim, hoc
        tamen non silebo, ipsum reddere hominem admirabilem in philosophia &amp;
        artibus omnibus liberalibus. Facit ad amorem, odium, invisibilitatem
        &amp; consecrationem eorum quæ sunt de dominatione Amaymonis: Et de
        potestate alterius exorcistæ tradit familiares, &amp; vera perfecte
        responsa de præsentibus, præteritis &amp; futuris. Velocissimo
        transcursu in varias regiones traducit hominem. Sexagintasex præest
        legionibus, &amp; fuit de Potestatum ordine.

        Gaap, alias Tap, a great president and a prince, he appeareth in a
        meridionall signe, and when he taketh humane shape [Clm 849 reads: He
        appears in the form of a doctor when he takes on a human form. He is the
        most excellent doctor of women, and he makes them burn with love for
        men.] he is the guide of the foure principall kings, as mightie as
        Bileth. There were certeine necromancers that offered sacrifices and
        burnt offerings unto him; and to call him up, they exercised an art,
        saieng that Salomon the wise made it. Which is false: for it was rather
        Cham, the sonne of Noah, who after the floud began first to invocate
        wicked spirits. He invocated Bileth, and made an art in his name, and a
        booke which is knowne to manie mathematicians. There were burnt
        offerings and sacrifices made, and gifts given, and much wickednes
        wrought by the exorcists, who mingled therewithall the holie names of
        God, the which in that art are everie where expressed. Marie [Certainly]
        there is an epistle of those names written by Salomon, as also write
        Helias Hierosolymitanus and Helisæus. It is to be noted, that if anie
        exorcist have the art of Bileth, and cannot make him stand before him,
        nor see him, I may not bewraie how and declare the meanes to conteine
        him, bicause it is abhomination, and for that I have learned nothing
        from Salomon of his dignitie and office. But yet I will not hide this;
        to wit, that he maketh a man woonderfull in philosophie and all the
        liberall sciences: he maketh love, hatred, insensibilitie,
        invisibilitie, consecration, and consecration of those things that are
        belonging unto the domination of Amaymon, and delivereth familiars out
        of the possession of other conjurors, answering truly and perfectly of
        things present, past, &amp; to come, &amp; transferreth men most
        speedilie into other nations, he ruleth sixtie six legions, &amp; was of
        the order of potestats.
