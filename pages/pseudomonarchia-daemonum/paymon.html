        Paymon obedit magis Lucifero quam alii reges. Lucifer hic intelligendus,
        qui in profunditate scientiæ suæ demersus, Deo assimilari voluit, &amp;
        ob hanc arrogantiam in exitium projectus est. De quo dictum est: Omnis
        lapis pretiosus operimentum tuum [Ezech. 28]. Paymon autem cogitur
        virtute divina, ut se sistat coram exorcista: ubi hominis induit
        simulachrum, insidens dromedario, coronaque insignitus lucidissima,
        &amp; vultu fœmineo. Hunc præcedit exercitus cum tubis &amp; cimbalis
        bene sonantibus, atque omnibus instrumentis Musicis, primo cum ingenti
        clamore &amp; rugitu apparens, sicut in Empto. Salomonis, &amp; arte
        declaratur. Et si Paymon hic quandoque loquitur, ut minus ab exorcista
        intelligatur, propterea is non tepescat: sed ubi porrexerit illi primam
        chartam ut voto suo obsequatur, jubebit quoque ut distincte &amp; aperte
        respondeat ad quæsita, &amp; de universa philosophia &amp; prudentia vel
        scientia, &amp; de cæteris arcanis. Et si voles cognoscere dispositionem
        mundi, &amp; qualis sit terra, aut quid eam sustineat in aqua, aut
        aliquid aliud, &amp; quid sit abyssus, &amp; ubi est ventus &amp; unde
        veniat, abunde te docebit. Accedant &amp; consecrationes tam de
        libationibus quam aliis. Confert hic dignitates &amp; confirmationes.
        Resistentes sibi suo vinculo deprimit, &amp; exorcistæ subjicit. Bonos
        comparat famulos, &amp; artium omnium intellectum. Notandum, quod in
        advocando hunc Paymonem, Aquilonem versus exorcistam conspicere
        oporteat, quæ ibi hujus sit hospitium. Accitum vero intrepide
        constanterque suscipiat, interroget, &amp; ab eo petat quicquid
        voluerit, nec dubie impetrabit. At ne creatorem oblivioni tradat,
        cavendum exorcistæ, propter ea quæ præmissa fuerunt de Paymone.
        Sunt qui dicunt, eum ex ordine Dominationum fuisse: sed aliis placet,
        ex ordine Cherubin. Hunc sequuntur legiones ducentæ, partim ex ordine
        Angelorum, partim Potestatum. Notandum adhæc, si Paymon solus fuerit
        citatus per aliquam libationem aut sacrificium, duo reges magni
        comitantur, scilicet Bebal &amp; Abalam, &amp; alii potentes. In hujus
        exercitu sunt vigintiquinque legiones: Quia spiritus his subjecti, non
        semper ipsis adsunt, nisi ut appareant, divina virtute compellantur.

        Paimon is more obedient in Lucifer than other kings are. Lucifer is
        heere to be understood he that was drowned in the depth of his
        knowledge: he would needs be like God, and for his arrogancie was
        throwne out into destruction, of whome it is said; Everie pretious stone
        is thy covering (Ezech. 88 [28.13].). Paimon is constrained by divine
        vertue to stand before the exorcist; where he putteth on the likenesse
        of a man: he sitteth on a beast called a dromedarie, which is a swift
        runner, and weareth a glorious crowne, and hath an effeminate
        countenance. There goeth before him an host of men with trumpets and
        well sounding cymbals, and all musicall instruments. At the first he
        appeereth with a great crie and roring, as in Circulo [Empto.]
        Salomonis, and in the art is declared. And if this Paimon speake
        sometime that the conjuror understand him not, let him not therefore be
        dismaied. But when he hath delivered him the first obligation to observe
        his desire, he must bid him also answer him distinctlie and plainelie to
        the questions he shall aske you, of all philosophie, wisedome, and
        science, and of all other secret things. And if you will knowe the
        disposition of the world, and what the earth is, or what holdeth it up
        in the water, or any other thing, or what is Abyssus, or where the wind
        is, or from whence it commeth, he will teach you aboundantlie.
        Consecrations also as well of sacrifices [offerings, libations] as
        otherwise may be reckoned. He giveth dignities and confirmations; he
        bindeth them that resist him in his owne chaines, and subjecteth them to
        the conjuror; he prepareth good familiars, and hath the understanding of
        all arts. Note, that at the calling up of him, the exorcist must looke
        towards the northwest, bicause there is his house. When he is called up,
        let the exorcist receive him constantlie without feare, let him aske
        what questions or demands he list, and no doubt he shall obteine the
        same of him. And the exorcist must beware he forget not the creator, for
        those things, which have beene rehearsed before of Paimon, some saie he
        is of the order of dominations; others saie, of the order of cherubim.
        There follow him two hundred legions, partlie of the order of angels,
        and partlie of potestates. Note that if Paimon be cited alone by an
        offering or sacrifice, two kings followe him; to wit, Beball &amp;
        Abalam, &amp; other potentates: in his host are twentie five legions,
        bicause the spirits subject to them are not alwaies with them, except
        they be compelled to appeere by divine vertue.
