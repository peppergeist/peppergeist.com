      <h2>Overview</h2>
        A game design document is one of the most important components of
        developing a video game. It contains a summary of all the elements of
        the game, including the mechanics, the story, the scope, etc. Creating
        a design document helps one completely organize their thoughts and ideas
        prior to implementation, which prevents having to make major design
        changes down the road and discarding previous development efforts.
        <p />
        Even though the design document is meant to guide the development
        process through the proposed design of the game, it is not meant to
        railroad it or restrict it. The design document is a living document,
        meaning that modifications are expected and encouraged during the
        development process.
        <p />
        Additionally, the presence of a design document is an absolute
        requirement for any professional publisher. It demonstrates preparedness
        and a bare minimum amount of "paperwork" required to specify what the
        project will deliver on. A good design document can turn a good pitch
        into a great one.
        <p />
        A typical design document will have various sections detailing the
        story, characters, level design, mechanics, and target audience of the
        game. The amount of detail which belongs in the document is up to the
        writer, but it is safer to keep essential aspects of the game strictly
        documented (like mechanics), and more nebulous details general.
      <h2>Breakdown</h2>
        This section details a breakdown of a sample game design document. While
        it specifies subsections and more detailed points of the document, only
        the major sections are necessary.
