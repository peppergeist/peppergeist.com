        My Thoughts on Windows 10

      <div class="indented">
        Normally I would not be using Windows 10, given the choice. When the
        free upgrade offer for Windows 7 users originally went up, I upgraded
        for about a week before "downgrading" back to 7. Windows 10 would not
        recognize my WiFi hardware and thus could not connect to the internet at
        all. Later, at work I was offered a choice between a MacBook Pro and an
        HP laptop, and I chose the HP laptop, as I had no experience with macOS
        at the time. The laptop was running Windows 10 and bluescreened twice
        within the first week of usage. I was not going to put up with such a
        terrible user experience so I swapped it for the MacBook and found macOS
        much more user-friendly. Also, it didn't crash, hang, or stutter when I
        tried to do my day-to-day tasks.
        <p />
        I recently purchased a T480 ThinkPad from Lenovo during a promotion. The
        only options for which OS the laptop would ship with were Windows 10 and
        Windows 10 Pro. This laptop came with a cutting-edge NVMe SSD, which
        would normally be a good thing. Unfortunately, my beloved Windows 7
        could not install onto an NVMe SSD out of the box without drivers
        present during the install process, and Microsoft had at one time
        provided a hotfix for this, but had since removed it from their site.
        So it seemed I was stuck.

      <h2>The Good</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Win10 <i>does</i> boast a number of improvements over Win7. Some of
        these are only temporary improvements, since the constant updates either
        slow down the machine or otherwise cause some serious choppiness.
        <ul>
          <li>Boot time for Win10 was generally faster than Win7.</li>
        </ul>
