        My Thoughts on Windows 10

      <div class="indented">
        Normally I would not be using Windows 10, given the choice. When the
        free upgrade offer for Windows 7 users originally went up, I upgraded
        for about a week before "downgrading" back to 7. Windows 10 would not
        recognize my WiFi hardware and thus could not connect to the internet at
        all. Later, at work I was offered a choice between a MacBook Pro and an
        HP laptop, and I chose the HP laptop, as I had no experience with macOS
        at the time. The laptop was running Windows 10 and bluescreened twice
        within the first week of usage. I was not going to put up with such a
        terrible user experience so I swapped it for the MacBook and found macOS
        much more user-friendly. Also, it didn't crash, hang, or stutter when I
        tried to do my day-to-day tasks.
        <p />
        I recently purchased a T480 ThinkPad from Lenovo during a promotion. The
        only options for which OS the laptop would ship with were Windows 10 and
        Windows 10 Pro. This laptop came with a cutting-edge NVMe SSD, which
        would normally be a good thing. Unfortunately, my beloved Windows 7
        could not install onto an NVMe SSD out of the box without drivers
        present during the install process, and Microsoft had at one time
        provided a hotfix for this, but had since removed it from their site.
        So it seemed I was stuck.

      <h2>The Good</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Win10 <i>does</i> boast a number of improvements over Win7. Some of
        these are only temporary improvements, since the constant updates either
        slow down the machine or otherwise cause some serious choppiness.
        <ol>
          <li>Boot time for Win10 was generally faster than Win7.</li>
          <li>Some applications performed much better on Win10. Notably, Steam.
          </li>
          <li>More display scaling options than Win7 out of the box.</li>
          <li>Multiple desktop/workspace support.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h2>The Bad</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        The part that surprised me the most about Win10 is the number of changes
        which were obfuscation of existing functionality in Win7 or outright
        downgrades from it. Many of these changes were wrapped under the guise
        of "features", since change is good (right?), but the majority of these
        were features no one asked for, at least not the end users.
        <ol>
          <li>The Control Panel is now split into a Settings application and the
          old Win7 control panel. Since functionality has also been split, they
          both open the other when changing certain settings.</li>
          <li>The updates for Win10 are a serious pain the ass. They nearly
          slow my computer to a crawl when downloading and installing the
          background, they hijack my session, and they consistently slow my boot
          time to a crawl after reboot.</li>
          <li>There is so much crap in Win10 which is openly user-hostile that
          it is incredible anyone signed off on it. There is pre-installed
          crapware, a useless Windows software center app ("for downloading
          trusted software").</li>
          <li>There are ads in the operating system. I don't need to go into
          whether or not you can turn them off, or if they should be called
          "targeted content", or if they are non-intrusive. They are ads IN THE
          OPERATING SYSTEM and that is absolutely unacceptable.</li>
        </ol>
