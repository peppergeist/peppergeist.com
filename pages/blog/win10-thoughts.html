        My Thoughts on Windows 10
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <h2>Catalyst</h2>
      Normally I would not be using Windows 10, given the choice. When the
      free upgrade offer for Windows 7 users originally went up, I upgraded
      for about a week before "downgrading" back to 7. Windows 10 would not
      recognize my WiFi hardware and thus could not connect to the internet at
      all. Later, at work I was offered a choice between a MacBook Pro and an
      HP laptop, and I chose the HP laptop, as I had no experience with macOS
      at the time. The laptop was running Windows 10 and bluescreened twice
      within the first week of usage. I was not going to put up with such a
      terrible user experience so I swapped it for the MacBook and found macOS
      much more user-friendly. Also, it didn't crash, hang, or stutter when I
      tried to do my day-to-day tasks.
      <p />
      I recently purchased a T480 ThinkPad from Lenovo during a promotion. The
      only options for which OS the laptop would ship with were Windows 10 and
      Windows 10 Pro. This laptop came with a cutting-edge NVMe SSD, which
      would normally be a good thing. Unfortunately, my beloved Windows 7
      could not install onto an NVMe SSD out of the box without drivers
      present during the install process, and Microsoft had at one time
      provided a hotfix for this, but had since removed it from their site.
      So it seemed I was stuck.
      <p />
      I bit the bullet and attempted to use Windows 10, for a brief amount of
      time. At least until it became unbearable. The following are my thoughts
      on this godforsaken operating system.
      <h2>The Good</h2>
      Win10 <i>does</i> boast a number of improvements over Win7. Some of
      these are only temporary improvements, since the constant updates either
      slow down the machine or otherwise cause some serious choppiness.
      <ol>
        <li>Boot time for Win10 was generally faster than Win7.</li>
        <li>Some applications performed much better on Win10. Notably, Steam.
        </li>
        <li>More display scaling options than Win7 out of the box.</li>
        <li>Multiple desktop/workspace support.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>The Bad</h2>
      The part that surprised me the most about Win10 is the number of changes
      which were obfuscation of existing functionality in Win7 or outright
      downgrades from it. Many of these changes were wrapped under the guise
      of "features", since change is good (right?), but the majority of these
      were features no one asked for, at least not the end users.
      <ol>
        <li>The Control Panel is now split into a Settings application and the
        old Win7 control panel. Since functionality has also been split, they
        both open the other when changing certain settings.</li>
        <li>The updates for Win10 are a serious pain the ass. They nearly
        slow my computer to a crawl when downloading and installing the
        background, they hijack my session, and they consistently slow my boot
        time to a few minutes after reboot.</li>
        <li>There is so much crap in Win10 which is openly user-hostile that
        it is incredible anyone signed off on it. There is pre-installed
        crapware, a useless Windows software center app ("for downloading
        trusted software"). Also, much of the crapware reinstalls itself after
        every Windows update.</li>
        <li>There are ads in the operating system. This is completely 
        unnacceptable.</li>
        <li>Energy optimization, even on battery-saving mode, is terrible. I
        can get approximately 10-20 hours of battery life doing low-load tasks
        like text editing, web browsing, and media consumption with the exact
        same computer running all three Linux distributions I tried on it
        (Debian, Xubuntu, Fedora). However, Win10 can barely hit 5 from basic
        browsing and media consumption.</li>
        <li>There was some suspicious behavior which definitely originates
        from OS-level processes. On my bare install, with no other programs
        installed, the command prompt box would at times appear for a
        split-second before disappearing again. Also, the fans would kick on
        every 20-30 minutes and run at top speed for a little bit. There were
        clearly built-in background processes that were not good at their
        power management.</li>
        <li>Folder organization is fairly screwy. There is a 3D Objects folder
        which I cannot seem to delete, and random folders appear in various
        places in my workspace just from running stock Windows applications.
        Once again, this is on a new, clean install.</li>
        <li>Windows tries to do a lot of things on its own and usually gets it
        wrong. For instance, it assumes that by default the user wants to have
        ads targeted to them in their OS, that the user wants a terrible voice
        assistant to permeate every task they undertake on the computer, and
        that they want their home folder to be the just the first five
        characters of their first name (
        <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/890812/how-to-rename-the-user-folder-in-windows-10">
        it's incredibly convoluted to change this, by the way</a>).</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>The <strike>Ugly</strike> Absolutely Disgusting</h2>
      Win10 is without a doubt one of the chunkiest, ugliest, choppiest OS-es
      I have ever had the misfortunate of being forced to use. Transitions
      stutter more often than not, the design is all across the board, there
      is no sense of unified design principles, and the whole mess just comes
      together within the first hour of use.
      <ol>
        <li>Official Windows applications themselves were not uniformly
        designed. There were different scrollbar styles, buttons styles,
        layouts, window handles, etc. Some had hamburger menus, others had
        sidebar menus, and none of them did it well. Because of this, it was
        difficult to intuit where common actions would be located in menus
        across applications that are supposed to comprise a suite.</li>
        <li>Scrolling is never uniform either. Not all applications support
        smooth scrolling, so there is really no point to enabling it, as about
        half of the applications ignored it altogether. Additionally, scrolling
        had a tendency to jump strangely when using a trackpad, and scrollbars
        will teleport back to their initial positions sometimes when the
        dragging motion ends too far from the window.</li>
        <li>There are so many slow and stuttery animations that do absolutely
        nothing to enhance the user experience. The tiles are annoying and the
        animations don't actually end where they should, so there is usually
        a small jump between the end of the animation and the actual gui.
        Additionally, waiting for animations to end to just to access the start
        menu or a settings dropdown is obnoxious.</li>
        <li>Resolution scaling is abysmal. The laptop I used had a high-dpi
        display, meaning that if Win10 rendered natively all the elements
        would appear very small. Win10 offered scaling options in order to
        make the screen more readable, but this usually came with the side
        effect of making applications blurry. Humorously enough, raising the
        scaling displayed a notification that Windows would attempt to make
        applications less blurry. It might have attempted, but it definitely
        did not succeed.</li>
        <li>Workflow optimization is hindered by the OS eating inputs while it
        is completing animations. For example, pressing the hotkey to open the
        Start Menu and typing to search for a program can cause it to ignore the
        first few keys you press while it is still animating the menu itself
        popping up. Turning off animations somehow still causes the OS to eat
        the keystrokes anyway.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Epilogue</h2>
      I uninstalled Win10 and put Debian on the laptop and now everything works.
