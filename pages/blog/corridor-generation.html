      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        When generating maps for <a href="/pages/projects/ithom.html">ITHOM</a>,
        a common issue which came up was the creation of corridors. For many map
        archetypes, the focus of the map was a collection of disjoint rooms,
        connected by a number of corridors. Generally, nothing of interest would
        be generated in corridors, and they would only serve as connecting
        passageways between rooms, which was where the action happened. However,
        sometimes this design process led to the introduction of particularly
        long corridors, with very little to interest the player traveling
        between rooms.
        <p /> In order to alleviate the samey-ness of corridors and introduce
        a little bit of variety into corridors, I explored a variety of
        algorithms to facilitate the creation of these structures.
      </div>
      <h2>The Problems</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        I started with a number of relatively uninteresting corridor designs.
        The first of these was the simple
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">
          A* pathfinding corridor
        </a>.
        This algorithm used the A* method to find the shortest path between two
        doors, shown as pluses in the diagram below:

      <br />
      <div class="unindented">
        This style of corridor is not ideal for a variety of reasons. First and
        foremost, it is ugly. It is the lowest-effort solution to connecting
        rooms and the player will be able to notice. I attempted a number of
        other similer solutions:

      axis-wise             simple pipe            NetHack-style    </pre>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="unindented">
        I think that it is obvious that out of all of the proposed solutions
        so far, the NetHack-style corridor is the least stupid-looking. The
        axis-wise implementation is possibly the ugliest implementation yet,
        and the simple pipe is not much better. The NetHack-style is still
        simple, but the algorithm prefers to change direction as little as
        possible, unless the slope differential becomes to great. This leads to
        a nicer looking zigzag curve when approaching the midpoint of the room
        connections. This solution is acceptable sometimes, and is used in the
        final build. However, this is not the final solution I wanted to settle
        on.
      </div>
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        I like the look of the NetHack-style corridor, but I wanted a little
        more variety in the bends of the corridor than just straight zigzags.
        My solution was to take the area between the two proposed doorways and
        superimpose a mask of "no-go" tiles. After this, the corridor generation
        algorithm would use a combination of simple A* pathfinding and slope
        detection to build a corridor between the two doors, while avoiding the
        no-go tiles as much as possible. Typically, the no-go tiles would be
        randomly selected to provide as much variety as possible, but sometimes
        would be randomly selected only in a single quadrant between the two
        doors and then symetrically mirrored across the other quadrants. The
        diagram below shows one such example of this method:

  define dead zones         dig corridor         remove dead zones  </pre>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="unindented">
        Step-by-step, the process is as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Define dead zones. In this case, the dead zone was defined only in
            one quadrant at random, and then symetrically mirrored across the
            other three quadrants. The dead zones are indicated by the Xs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use A* pathfinding to dig from one door to another. Dead zones
            prevent the generation of corridors. Additionally, when the slope
            becomes too great on the point between where the corridor digger
            currently is with regards to its destination point, the algorithm
            will change directions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the dead zones. The result is a corridor which generally
            moves from point A to point B, but without being too generic, too
            repetitive, or too uninteresting.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p />Not wanted to discard the previous research I had done into the
        other methods, the map generator sometimes resorts to the other corridor
        generations as well, to provide even more variety.
