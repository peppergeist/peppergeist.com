            <div class="Indented">
                I enjoy playing video games in my spare time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a> especially.
                Roguelikes are generally characterized by procedurally generated stages, an overall high level of difficulty, permanent player death when losing, and large amounts of replayability.
                Roguelikes that feature only one or two of these characteristics are usually called "rogue-lites".
                Usually, roguelikes have a steep learning curve with a lot of intricate mechanics that need to be understood in order to complete the game.
                I have collected the things I have learned from playing these games on their respective pages, in hopes they can help newer players succeed or inform experienced players of things they may not have previously been aware of.
                <br />
                It should go without saying that these pages contain spoilers for both plot and gameplay, so proceed at your own risk.

            <div class="Indented">
                Nethack is one of the oldest roguelikes I reguarly play.
                It remains one of the most popular roguelikes to date as well, and is available on nearly every system imaginable.
                As one of the most complicated rogulikes on this list, I will keep my tips as general as possible.

            <div>
                Spelunky is a platforming rogue-lite which was originally made for Windows and then later remade for Xbox 360 arcade.
                It features extremely tight controls and thematically cohesive game mechanics that make it one of my favorite games of all time.

            <div class="Indented">
                The Binding of Isaac is a room-based twin stick shooter with roguelike elements.
                It has an enormous amount of content and replayability that makes it another one of my favorite games of all time.

            <div class="Indented">
                Downwell is a compact little rogue-lite released on both PC and iOS.
                There is very little actual strategy involved in playing, but the game nevertheless has the full feature set of a true roguelike.

            <div class="Indented">
                Enter The Gungeon is room-based twin stick shooter with roguelike elements, much like The Binding of Isaac, but is generally much slower and gameplay is more dependent on random elements rather than skill of the player.
                While there is much less choice and strategy in this game than most roguelikes, the player can make key decisions which will at least mitigate the chances of randomness making the game drab.
