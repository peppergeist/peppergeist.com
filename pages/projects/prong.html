        PRONG is a JRPG adventure mechanically inspired by several games:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%26_Luigi:_Superstar_Saga">
          Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga
        </a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario:_The_Thousand-Year_Door">
          Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
        </a>,
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound">EarthBound</a>.
        You play as a fairly unimportant mailer daemon, a magical being called
        into existence when someone posts a letter.
        Once you make your delivery, you wink out of existence,
        your duty fulfilled.
        However, you have some issues: no one knows who sent the letter,
        and the recipient is the Queen of Ucadia, who has been missing for a
        <i>very</i> long time.
        Unable to complete your delivery, you decide to make the best
        out of your situation and make some friends, explore the world,
        and unravel the greatest story of Ucadia.

        Features
      </h2>
      <div class="indented">
        The game features a fully-populated overworld, with all sorts
        of interesting areas to explore and people to meet.
        There are a wide array of fantabulous and ridiculous enemies to fight,
        along with unique bosses (some of which may be your friends).
        Your moves in combat are based on whatever mail you currently have in
        your magical messenger bag of holding, which keeps fights constantly
        changing.
