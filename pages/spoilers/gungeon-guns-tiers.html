        The Guns of Enter The Gungeon: A Definitive Tier List
      </h1>
      <hr />

        I have painstakingly ranked every single gun of this game into tiers
        based on usefulness.

      <h2>But why would you do such a thing</h2>
      I'll tell you why. Enter The Gungeon defines its own tiers of rarity for
      all of the guns, but rarity more often than not doesn't correlate with
      actual usefulness of the gun. Some D-tier guns are excellent, and some
      S-tier guns are near worthless. Since rarity is only a rough indicator of
      gun efficacy and you don't want to waste your time slogging through the
      game with the wrong gun, I have defined my own tiers as followed:
      <dl>
        <dt>Useless</dt>
        <dd>This gun should never be used unless circumstances are particularly
        dire. Even your starting weapon would be better than this gun.</dd>
        <dt>Okay</dt>
        <dd>This gun should be a backup and is not very useful. However, it will
        work if nothing better is available. This gun is comparable to starting
        weaponry.</dd>
        <dt>Good</dt>
        <dd>This gun can be used for most situations and should not be discarded
        if it can be avoided.</dd>
        <dt>Great</dt>
        <dd>This gun can be relied on for the entire game.</dd>
        <dt>Bonkers</dt>
        <dd>This gun makes the game so easy it might as well be playing itself.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      Also, I might add (room) or (boss) after the ranking to indicate that the
      gun is much more useful when clearing rooms or fighting bosses,
      respectively.
      <h2>The List</h2>
      Without further ado, here is every single gun in Enter The Gungeon.
