        Overview
      </h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Since nearly all mechanics of this game are already well-documented
        in the wiki and other various places, this page is primarily focused
        on overall strategy and useful tips.
      </div>
      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <h3>Getting to Yama</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In the Mines, you must find the Key.</li>
        <li>
          A locked chest will be preset on the same level as the Key.
          Bring the Key to the chest to get the Udjat Eye.
          The Udjat Eye is not strictly necessary, but without it you must find
          the Black Market with no audio cues, which can be very difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Jungle, there is a stage with the entrance to the Black Market
          hidden behind some terrain. Sometimes the sides of the entrance are
          visible adjacent to it, if there is no terrain covering it.
          The Udjat Eye will begin to blink and make a noise when you get closer
          to the entrance. The entrance is wherever the Eye blinks the fastest.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the Black Market.</li>
        <li>
          In the Black Market, on the far right of the map, there is a specialty
          shop which only sells the Ankh, for $50,000. You must either purchase
          it or steal it.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Ice Caves, there is a level with a large Moai head statue on
          it. You must die on this level, and the Ankh will respawn you inside
          of the head. After respawning, the Hedjet will drop from above the
          spelunker onto them to collect. Make sure you wait before going
          through the exit for the Hedjet to drop, otherwise you will not be
          able to access the City of Gold.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Temple, you must kill Anubis and take his Sceptre.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Temple, there is a level with a golden door on it. It unlocks
          by standing in front of it while holding the Sceptre, and if you have
          the Hedjet obtained as well. After it unlocks, you can enter it to 
          get to the City of Gold.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the City of Gold, in the center of the map, the Book of the Dead
          sits on a dais. Take it and exit the level. Beware, Anubis will
          come back and attack you a second time.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the fight with Olmec, observe the Book of the Dead. Wherever it
          gnashes the fastest is where you must have Olmec land in the lava
          below. There will be a door right above the lava, you must stand on
          Olmec's head as he is sinking into the lava to enter it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fight your way through Hell Temple to reach Yama. Consider obtaining
          Vlad's Amulet in the tower to become fireproof to make the final
          battle less dangerous.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Items
      </h2>
      <div class="indented">
        There are many items in Spelunky, and they all fall under three
        specific categories:
        <ul>
          <li>Consumable - Multiple amounts of these items may be picked up
            and used one at a time. This category includes things like
            ropes and bombs.
          </li>
          <li>Passive - These items, once picked up, cannot be dropped.
            They can be picked up multiple times, but it does not affect
            their efficacy.
          </li>
          <li>Active - These items must be held in the spelunker's hands
            in order to be used. You may only hold one of these items at a time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        I have listed all the items below divided into my own three categories:
        very useful items, useful items, and not-so-useful items.
        Obtaining a number of "very useful items" is generally required to beat
        the game at all, while having "useful" items certainly makes it easier.
        "Not-so-useful" items can be ignored altogether or even detrimental
        when picked up.
