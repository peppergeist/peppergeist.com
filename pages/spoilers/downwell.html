        This is a spoiler page for Downwell.
      </div>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Downwell is a minimalistic roguelike-platformer hybrid. It is very short
        and small, but has a surprisingly level of mechanical depth which makes
        it entertaining to play many times over. Given that the scope of the
        game is quite small and pretty much all mechanics have been fairly
        well-documented, this spoiler page will just contain various tips rather
        than an outright guide. There are plenty of guides available elsewhere
        on the internet.
        <br />
        The game is playable on both PC and iOS/Android, but I have found it is
        much easier with a keyboard than a touch screen. This is due to the
        control buttons being at the bottom of the screen on mobile, such that
        your fingers obscure upcoming enemies and obstacles more often than not.
      </div>
      <h2>Upgrades</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Generally, you may choose one of three upgrades at the end of each
        level. If you are using boulder style, you only have two choices, and if
        you are using handstand style, you will not be offered upgrades at all.
        The "Youth" upgrade gives you an additional upgrade option after each
        level. I have listed the upgrades below and categorized them by
        usefulness.
        <dl>
          <dt>Apple</dt>
          <dd>
            Not useful. Restores 4 health. If you are at full health, it grants
            you an extra health container. Unless you are in low health, I don't
            recommend it, as health is not necessary if you don't take damage.
          </dd>
          <dt>Blast Module</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. Causes an explosion beneath you when stomping on an enemy.
            Great for clearing out large amounts of enemies at once and also
            destroying collections of blocks simultaneously.
          </dd>
          <dt>Candle</dt>
          <dd>
            Not useful. Grants a longer amount of invincibility after taking
            damage. This upgrade is near-useless if you don't take damage often.
          </dd>
          <dt>Drone</dt>
          <dd>
            Conditionally useful. Spawns a friendly robot drone that shoots when
            you shoot. It follows near you and not exactly behind you, such that
            it gives you a little extra width on your bullet spread. I have
            found that it does not make a huge difference, especially when your
            primary method of killing enemies is stomping on them.
          </dd>
          <dt>Gem Attractor</dt>
          <dd>
            Very useful. Sucks in nearby gems. Maximizing your gem count is the
            best way to get the most value out of shops, so getting this early
            is extremely handy.
          </dd>
          <dt>Gem Powered</dt>
          <dd>
            Very useful. Refills ammo when picking up gems. This makes it much
            easier to build up a sizable combo for bonuses. It also makes Limbo
            easier, as Limbo doesn't have nearly as much to stomp on as the
            other worlds. This upgrade synergizes very well with Gem Attractor.
          </dd>
          <dt>Gem Sick</dt>
          <dd>
            Very useful. Increases duration of Gem High. Gem High increases 
            weapon range and damage, both very useful attributes.
          </dd>
          <dt>Gunpowder Blocks</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful (especially in the early game). Blocks shoot a bullet upwards
            when destroyed. Additionally, destroying a block will cause a chain
            reaction which destroys all the blocks near it as well. This makes
            it easy to clear out large amounts of blocks which are preventing
            a smooth descent. It also usually kills most enemies above the
            blocks from the resulting bullets.
          </dd>
          <dt>Heart Balloon</dt>
          <dd>
            Not useful. Gives you a heart balloon which reduces your fall speed
            while you have it. If an enemy touches it, the balloon explodes,
            respawning once you complete the level. Given how easy it is for the
            balloon to pop, it doesn't provide much use past the first portion
            of any level.
          </dd>
          <dt>Hot Casing</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. The discarded casing from shooting the gun boots deal
            damage. This upgrade is useful for dealing with large amounts of
            enemies which are not directly below you, particularly whne you have
            a gun which shoots a lot of bullets very quickly.
          </dd>
          <dt>Knife and Fork</dt>
          <dd>
            Very useful. Touching a corpse causes you to "eat" it. Eating ten
            corpses grants you +1 health. Not only is this upgrade a good way to
            stay in good health, it can often increase your maximum health. It
            is particularly useful in the Aquifer zone, in which corpses fall
            very slowly and are easy to catch up to while falling.
          </dd>
          <dt>Laser Sight</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. Grants a laser sight beneath the player for aiming and also
            increases the range of the gun. The first benefit doesn't really do
            much, but the added range is actually quite useful for nearly all
            weapons other than the laser, which already has infinite range.
          </dd>
          <dt>Member's Card</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. Grants a 10% discount at shops and increases the number of
            shops. This upgrade is obviously better the earlier you get it,
            especially if you are collecting a large number of gems.
          </dd>
          <dt>Popping Gems</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. Getting a gem shoots a bullet upwards from the player. This
            upgrade becomes more useful later in the game when there are more
            enemies coming from above. This also synergizes very well with Gem
            Attractor, as you will be shooting a lot more bullets upward from
            all the gems attracted.
          </dd>
          <dt>Rest in Pieces</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. Shooting corpses causes them to explode, damaging nearby
            enemies. This upgrade is great for clearing out large numbers of
            enemies in groups. Note that it has a negative synergy with Knife
            and Fork, as shooting the corpse makes it impossible to consume it.
          </dd>
          <dt>Reverse Engineering</dt>
          <dd>
            Not useful. Allows you reroll each gun module once by shooting it.
            None of the weapons are bad enough to warrant rerolling, unless you
            are really trying to stick to your favorite weapons.
          </dd>
          <dt>Rocket Jump</dt>
          <dd>
            Not useful. Creates an explosion when jumping from solid ground.
            Given that it is not usually good practice to spend a lot of time
            on the ground in Downwell, this upgrade is not very useful.
          </dd>
          <dt>Safety Jetpack</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. When out of bullets, allows the player to hover for a short
            time. Recharges when landing on stomping on enemies. This can allow
            for some additional time needed to keep up a combo or move out of
            danger.
          </dd>
          <dt>Timeout</dt>
          <dd>
            Not useful. Creates a space where time freezes whenever you get hit.
            Not only is this upgrade made entirely useless by good dodging, it
            is actually quite difficult to remain in the time void once it is
            created.
          </dd>
          <dt>Youth</dt>
          <dd>
            Useful. Gives you +1 health and an additional upgrade option to
            choose from at the end of each level, for the remainder of the run.
            Note that the usefulness of this upgrade falls off drastically the
            further you get in the run, as you have less chances to actually
            make use of the additional upgrade option.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <h2>Styles</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Styles are permanent modifiers chosen at the beginning of a run which
        are in effect until the end of the run. You cannot change your style
        mid-run.
        <dl>
          <dt>Arm Spin Style</dt>
          <dd>
            Eliminates gem veins from side rooms such that only gun modules
            appear. Shops also become more rare. This style is useful for when
            you are not that interested in making use of gems, preferring to
            maximize your firepower and health through upgrades and gun modules.
          </dd>
          <dt>Boulder Style</dt>
          <dd>
            Increases your starting health to 6 and makes you fall slightly
            faster. Additionally, it lowers the number of upgrade options you
            get at the end of each level to two, but this can still be increased
            by the Youth ugprade. This style is useful if you need the health or
            just want to go fast, but otherwise, dodging is always preferable to
            increased health.
          </dd>
          <dt>Handstand Style</dt>
          <dd>
            Grants a 30% discount at all shops, but you are offered no upgrade
            options at the end of a level. Given that upgrades are usually vital
            to the success of a run, this style is pretty bad.
          </dd>
          <dt>Levitate Style</dt>
          <dd>
            Decreases your falling speed, as if you had the Heart Balloon
            upgrade. This style is very useful for building up large combos, as
            the increased hangtime gives you more time to maneuver to avoid
            landing prematurely.
          </dd>
          <dt>Usual Style</dt>
          <dd>
            The standard, starting style. You start the game with no special
            modifiers.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <h2>Worlds</h2>
      <div class="indented">
        There are four worlds in Downwell: Caverns, Catacombs, Aquifer, and
        Limbo. Each world contains unique enemies and other features.
        <dl>
          <dt>World 1: Caverns</dt>
          <dd>
            The Caverns are mainly full of weak enemies and groups of blocks.
            This are is good for getting a lot of gems quickly from combos, as
            it is relatively safe compared to other worlds.
          </dd>
          <dt>World 2: Catacombs</dt>
          <dd>
            The Catacombs are full of ghosts and skeleton enemies. Beware of
            differently-colored floors, as spikes will pop out of them shortly
            after landing on them. There are also areas entirely blocked by
            groups of destructible blocks, which makes the Gunpowder Blocks
            upgrade very useful in this world. You will have to be a little more
            careful where you shoot in this world, as floating skulls will
            become enraged when shot and follow you. Also, the large ghosts are
            very tanky and take a lot of bullets to kill, so I recommend just
            stomping on them whenever possible as that instantly kills them.
          </dd>
          <dt>World 3: Aquifer</dt>
          <dd>
            The Aquifer world takes place entirely underwater, meaning that you
            have to constantly break debris and shells in order to consume
            bubbles for air. If your air meter drops to 0, you will begin to
            take damage very quickly. Note that in Hard Mode your air meter will
            run out much faster and you will have to collect single bubbles as
            you fall. Due to the water, corpses in this world fall much slower
            than in the other worlds, making it easier to catch up with them
            and consume them with the Fork and Knife upgrade.
          </dd>
          <dt>World 4: Limbo</dt>
          <dd>
            In Limbo, there are very few platforms and you must kill the
            phantom enemies by shooting at them rather than stomping, as they
            deal damage upon direct contact. Limbo is a great place to rack up
            large combos since there is very little solid ground to land on and
            cash in. Note that even in side areas where it appears like there is
            no ledge to cash in a combo, walking off the ledge from the time
            bubble will indeed trigger the combo to end, allowing you to start
            a new combo whenever you see a side area.
