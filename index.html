        About me
      </h2>
      <div class="indented">
        Howdy. I'm Colton, and this is my website.
        I enjoy programming, reading, making music and making software.
        My hobbies include ghosts, peppers, and little green ghouls.
        Also, I make software in my spare time.
        I am a backend software developer.
        I build software that interfaces between the accounting team
        and selling team at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>.
        My work allows people to import products which are normally
        not available in their country direct via Amazon.
        I'm currently working on automating my own job.
        <br />
        <br />
        I studied applied mathematics at
        <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" title="gig 'em">
          Texas A&amp;M University
        </a>
        with a specialization in computer science and encryption/decryption.
        Perhaps one day I'll be able to put that to good use.

      <div class="indented">
        I enjoy playing video games to relax, roguelikes especially.
        Roguelikes typically require a lot of knowledge about internal mechanics
        and strategy in order to beat them.
        Because of this, I have compiled all my useful knowledge on
        the various roguelikes I have played into spoiler pages that players
        might find useful.
