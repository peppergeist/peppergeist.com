				About me
			</h2>
			<div class="Indented">
				Hi I'm Colton, this is my website.
				I enjoy programming, reading, making music and making games.
				My hobbies include ghosts, peppers, and electronics.
				Also I make software in my spare time.
				I am a backend web developer.
				I build software that interfaces between the accounting team and selling team at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>.
				My work allows people to import products which are normally not available in their country direct via Amazon.
				I'm currently working on automating my own job.
				<br>
				<br>
				I studied applied mathematics at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" title="gig 'em">Texas A&amp;M University</a> with a specialization in computer science and encryption/decryption.
				Perhaps one day I'll be able to put that to good use.

				Personal projects and other work
			</h2>
			<div class="Indented">
				Here you'll find my personal projects, mostly games.
				I am currently learning to draw and make music using a computer, so I have a lot of little games in development.
				I am also currently in the process of transitioning some of them from Clickteam Fusion Studio 2.5 to Gamemaker Studio 2, so most of them are pretty skeletal right about now.
				<h3>
					<a href="pages/ithom.html">ITHOM</a>
				</h3>
				ITHOM is a text-based roguelike played in the terminal window.
				You play as a scamming miscreant who has made a living selling snake oil to people paranoid of catching an epidemic illness which leaves its victims in a permanent coma.
				A person becomes infected by falling asleep within the vicinity of someone who has already contracted it.
				Doing so imprisons that person's consciousness in a large, paradoxial dream dungeon known to its inhabitants as Mononeir.
				The marble halls of Mononeir wind slowly downwards into deeper and more dangerous depths.
				It is known there exists an archive, an academy, a prison, and more somewhere below where most inhabitants have taken refuge.
				Only by fighting your way downwards through the dreamlike labyrinth will you be able to find and confront the host of the dream, and perhaps find a way out...
				<br>
				<br>
				ITHOM is currently very in progress and only has preliminary dungeon-generation algorithms and map structures currently working.
				The project page is private as I would like to make it public once it has more content, and a website is in development for it as well.
				<h3>
					<a href="pages/voltimandland.html">Voltimand Land</a>
				</h3>
				Voltimand Land is an homage to the Wario Land series of games, featuring a treasure-hunting protagonist looting the remains of a spooky castle.
				It showcases many of the iconic mechanics, such as the charge and ground-pound, and adds a couple more.
				The art style is strongly inspired by Locomalito's <a href="https://www.locomalito.com/abbaye_des_morts.php">L'abbaye des Morts</a>, a little explorative platformer, and GameBoy Color palettes.
				<h3>
					<a href="pages/prong.html">PRONG</a>
				</h3>
				PRONG is a classic-style RPG also in development.
				All the sprites on this site are assets from PRONG.
				You play as a rogue mailer daemon on a quest to return a letter.
				On the way, you can make friends, eat food, trick-or-treat, and possibly save the world.
				More information coming later (by later I mean as I flesh out the story more).
				<h3>
					<a href="pages/numbertumbler.html">Number Tumbler</a>
				</h3>
				Number Tumbler is a teeny tiny game made in the Jack programming language for one of my classes in college.
				You can download from my GitHub page as well as play a demo version on it in your web browser.
